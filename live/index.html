        <h3>Lose yourself in Meld</h3>
        <p>
          Live’s new MPE-capable synthesizer is designed for sound variety,
          playfulness and character. Equipped with two independent oscillators
          and an extensive modulation matrix, Meld excels at textural
          soundscapes, harmonic and atonal sounds, and rhythmic drones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meld’s Macro Oscillators provides simple access of complex waveforms
          made by various synthesis methods. Quickly dial up subtractive, FM,
          granular, and other sources, quantize the oscillators to a scale and
          even use the LFOs from one oscillator to modulate the other.

          Bathe your sound in subtle warmth – or break it down with wild

          three saturation stages for serial, parallel or even mid/side and
          multiband configurations. Its built-in compressor and feedback routing
          give you even more ways to shape your sound, and its modulation
          section lets you add dynamic, evolving saturation and color.

                Discover new sounds and find them again easier with the help of
                Live’s new tagging system. All factory sound content – including
                Packs – in Live now comes labeled in the Browser with instrument
                categories and helpful musical descriptors – and if you want
                more tags, you can create your own.

                Get search results that cover the whole library, rather than
                being confined to the Browser’s built-in categories. And explore
                your search history to see sounds or presets you've previously
                looked for.

                Try Live's new Sound Similarity Search to find sounds with
                similar characteristics to the one you're working on. Start with
                a sample and tell Live’s browser to find comparable sounds and
                instrument presets, with the help of a neural network.

                Swap all the samples in your Drum Rack for similar ones to
                quickly try out new percussive textures – like a drum machine
                with seemingly-infinite kits.
