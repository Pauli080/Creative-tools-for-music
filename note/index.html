                and intuitive way to write, record, and perform your musical

                Live 12’s latest improvements, too.

              Cloud, you can send your Note Set to Live without leaving the app. Then keep 
              working with all the same devices as in Note, but with additional parameters 
              available. You can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds

                    lines with melodic presets, finger-drum beats using Drum Sampler 
                    kits, and create instrumental melodies with Melodic Sampler 
                    instruments. Use Reverb, Delay and Chorus-Ensemble to give your 
                    sounds space and depth, or play with color and texture using 
                    Saturator, Redux and Phaser-Flanger.
